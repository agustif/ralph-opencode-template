# Suggestion 3.1: Cache Command Existence Checks

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** ralph.sh:65

**Rationale:** The recommendation itself states "No change needed, already optimal." This is just documentation, not a code change. Adding comments to document an optimization that's already in place is unnecessary overhead for a minimal tool.

### 3.1 Cache Command Existence Checks
**Location:** ralph.sh:65

**Issue:** opencode check happens every run (though only once per execution).

**Current State:** Already optimal - runs once per script invocation.

**Recommendation:** No change needed, but document this optimization in comments:
```bash
# Check once at startup - cached for all iterations
command -v opencode >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "opencode not found in PATH"; exit 1; }
```

**Rationale:** Documents optimization decision, prevents premature refactoring.
