# Suggestion 6.10: Add Template System

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** Create new file

**Rationale:** Adds complexity with a template command and template management. Users can copy example specs from the examples/ directory instead. This is over-engineering.

### 6.10 Add Template System
**Location:** Create new file

**Issue:** Every new task requires writing spec from scratch.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add template command to main dispatcher
template)
    shift
    TEMPLATE_NAME="${1:-basic}"
    shift
    
    case "$TEMPLATE_NAME" in
        basic)
            cat << 'EOF'
# TASK
[Describe your task here]

# RULES
- Do ONE bounded increment only.
- Minimal diff. No repo-wide churn.
- If you change code: run all VERIFIERS before finishing.
- Append one short line to `progress.log` (timestamp, what changed, what's next).
- If you are done and verifiers pass, print exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

# VERIFIERS
[Add your verifiers here]
EOF
            ;;
        research)
            cat << 'EOF'
# TASK
[Describe research topic]

# SCOPE
- Define scope
- Define exclusions

# SEED LIST
- Topic 1
- Topic 2

# RULES
- Remove items from SEED LIST as completed
- Save findings to docs/research/[topic].md
- If done, print exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

# VERIFIERS
- [[ -d "docs/research" ]] && echo "✓ Research directory exists"
EOF
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Unknown template: $TEMPLATE_NAME"
            echo "Available templates: basic, research"
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
    ;;
```

**Rationale:** Reduces boilerplate, provides best practice starting points, improves consistency.
