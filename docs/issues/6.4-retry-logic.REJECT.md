# Suggestion 6.4: Add Retry Logic

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** opencode execution

**Rationale:** Adds complexity with retry counting and exponential backoff logic. While robust, this is over-engineering for a minimal tool. The timeout handling is sufficient.

### 6.4 Add Retry Logic
**Location:** opencode execution

**Issue:** Transient failures cause entire run to fail.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add retry logic with exponential backoff
MAX_RETRIES=3
RETRY_DELAY=5

for attempt in $(seq 1 "$MAX_RETRIES"); do
    if timeout "$TIMEOUT" opencode run "$INSTRUCTION" --file "$SPEC" -m "$MODEL" 2>&1 | tee "$TMPOUT"; then
        break  # Success
    else
        if [[ "$attempt" -lt "$MAX_RETRIES" ]]; then
            echo "Turn $i failed (attempt $attempt/$MAX_RETRIES), retrying in ${RETRY_DELAY}s..."
            sleep "$RETRY_DELAY"
            RETRY_DELAY=$((RETRY_DELAY * 2))  # Exponential backoff
        else
            echo "Turn $i failed after $MAX_RETRIES attempts"
            # Decide whether to continue or exit
        fi
    fi
done
```

**Rationale:** Improves robustness against network issues, API rate limits, temporary failures.
