# Suggestion 6.1: Add Resume Capability

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** cmd_run function

**Rationale:** Adds complexity with state tracking and JSONL parsing. While useful, this is over-engineering for a minimal tool. Users can restart with adjusted turn counts if interrupted. Not essential.

### 6.1 Add Resume Capability
**Location:** cmd_run function

**Issue:** Cannot resume from interrupted runs, loses progress.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add --resume flag
if [[ "${1:-}" == "--resume" ]]; then
    RESUME_MODE="true"
    # Find last completed turn from JSONL
    if [[ -f "$JSONL" ]]; then
        LAST_TURN=$(tail -1 "$JSONL" | grep -o '"turn":[0-9]*' | cut -d: -f2)
        LAST_TURN=$((LAST_TURN + 1))
        echo "Resuming from turn $LAST_TURN"
        for i in $(seq "$LAST_TURN" "$N"); do
            # ... rest of loop
        done
    else
        echo "No previous run found, starting fresh"
    fi
    shift
fi
```

**Rationale:** Saves time and resources when runs are interrupted, improves reliability.
