# Suggestion 4.2: Add Summary Statistics

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** After loop completion

**Rationale:** Nice-to-have feature that adds code complexity without essential value. The tool's purpose is to run the loop; users can gather statistics from the log files if needed. Aligned with minimalist philosophy.

### 4.2 Add Summary Statistics
**Location:** After loop completion

**Issue:** No summary of what was accomplished.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add after loop exits (before exit 0 or 1)
if [[ "$TEST_MODE" != "true" ]]; then
    DURATION=$(( $(date +%s) - START_TIME ))
    LOG_LINES=$(wc -l < "$LOG" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    LOG_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$LOG" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$LOG" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    
    echo ""
    echo "=== Summary ==="
    echo "Total turns: $i"
    echo "Duration: ${DURATION}s"
    echo "Log file: $LOG (${LOG_SIZE} bytes, ${LOG_LINES} lines)"
    echo "Output: $([[ -f "$JSONL" ]] && wc -l < "$JSONL" || echo 0) JSON records"
    echo "=============="
fi
```

**Rationale:** Provides closure and useful metrics for optimization.
