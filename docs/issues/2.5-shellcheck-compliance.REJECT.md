# Suggestion 2.5: Add Shellcheck Compliance

**Status:** REJECTED

**Original Location:** All shell scripts

**Rationale:** Rejected as a runtime dependency - shellcheck should not be bundled or required for ralph.sh to run. However, it's been added as an optional development tool in the Makefile (`make shellcheck`) for developers who want to use it. This maintains the minimalist philosophy while providing quality checks for contributors.

### 2.5 Add Shellcheck Compliance
**Location:** All shell scripts

**Issue:** No automated shell script quality checking.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add `.shellcheckrc` file:
```ini
# .shellcheckrc
disable=SC2086,SC2154
exclude=SC1090
```

2. Add Makefile target:
```makefile
shellcheck:
	shellcheck ralph.sh install.sh convert_log.sh

lint: shellcheck test
```

3. Add CI configuration (if applicable):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
name: ShellCheck
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  shellcheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: ludeeus/action-shellcheck@master
```

**Rationale:** Catches common shell script bugs before they cause issues, improves code quality.
