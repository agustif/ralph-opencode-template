# Suggestion 1.1: Enhance Model Name Validation

**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Original Location:** ralph.sh:54

**Rationale:** This is a critical security improvement. The current regex allows leading/trailing special characters and could enable injection attacks. The suggested fix is simple, minimal, and maintains flexibility for valid model names while significantly reducing the attack surface.

### 1.1 Enhance Model Name Validation
**Location:** ralph.sh:54

**Issue:** Current regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]+$` is too permissive and could allow injection attacks.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Replace line 54 with stricter validation
[[ "$MODEL" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._/-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$ ]] && [[ ! "$MODEL" =~ \.\. ]] || { echo "Invalid model name format"; exit 1; }
```

**Rationale:** Prevents leading/trailing special characters and reduces attack surface while maintaining flexibility for valid model names.
