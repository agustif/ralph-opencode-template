# Suggestion 3.2: Optimize Promise Token Search

**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Original Location:** ralph.sh:83

**Rationale:** Performance optimization that avoids O(n*m) complexity. Instead of scanning entire log files on every iteration, track promise token status in a variable. This is much faster for long runs with minimal code complexity.

### 3.2 Optimize Promise Token Search
**Location:** ralph.sh:83

**Issue:** Grep scans entire log files on every iteration.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Track promise token status in a variable
PROMISE_FOUND="false"

# Inside the loop after writing output
if grep -q "$PROMISE_TOKEN" <<< "$OUTPUT"; then
    PROMISE_FOUND="true"
    break
fi

# At end of loop
[[ "$PROMISE_FOUND" == "true" ]] && exit 0
```

**Rationale:** Avoids O(n*m) complexity, much faster for long runs.
