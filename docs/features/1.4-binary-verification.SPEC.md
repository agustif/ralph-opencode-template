# Suggestion 1.4: Add Binary Verification for opencode

**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Original Location:** ralph.sh:65

**Rationale:** Simple security improvement that prevents confusion from shadowed binaries or PATH manipulation attacks. Uses standard bash commands to verify the binary is executable and in PATH. Minimal complexity for clear security benefit.

### 1.4 Add Binary Verification for opencode
**Location:** ralph.sh:65

**Issue:** No verification that opencode command is actually the expected tool.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Enhance line 65 check
OPENCODE_PATH=$(command -v opencode 2>/dev/null) || { echo "opencode not found in PATH"; exit 1; }
[[ -x "$OPENCODE_PATH" ]] || { echo "opencode not executable: $OPENCODE_PATH"; exit 1; }
# Optional: add hash verification if you distribute known-good binaries
```

**Rationale:** Prevents confusion from shadowed binaries or PATH manipulation attacks.
