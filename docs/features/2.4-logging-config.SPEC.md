### 2.4 Add Logging Configuration at Startup
**Location:** cmd_run function start

**Issue:** No visibility into what configuration is being used.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add after validation section, before main loop
echo "=== Ralph $RALPH_VERSION ==="
echo "Config:"
echo "  Turns: $N"
echo "  Spec: $SPEC"
echo "  Model: $MODEL"
echo "  Log: $LOG"
echo "  Timeout: ${TIMEOUT}s"
echo "  Modes: Test=$TEST_MODE, YOLO=$YOLO_MODE, JSON=$JSON_MODE"
echo "========================="
```

**Rationale:** Provides visibility into configuration, helps debugging, documents what was run.
