# Suggestion 5.4: Add Example Specs

**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Original Location:** examples/ directory

**Rationale:** Provides starting points and demonstrates best practices. Example specs are static files that don't change tool behavior but significantly reduce learning curve for new users. Low complexity, high value.

### 5.4 Add Example Specs
**Location:** examples/ directory

**Issue:** Limited examples for new users.

**Recommendation:**
Create several example specs:

`examples/simple-task.md`:
```markdown
# TASK
Create a simple "Hello World" program in Python.

# RULES
- Do ONE bounded increment only.
- Minimal diff. No repo-wide churn.
- If you change code: run all VERIFIERS before finishing.
- If you are done and verifiers pass, print exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

# VERIFIERS
- [[ -f "hello.py" ]] && echo "✓ Program file exists"
- python3 hello.py | grep -q "Hello, World" && echo "✓ Output correct"
```

`examples/research-task.md`:
```markdown
# TASK
Research the best practices for shell scripting in 2025.

# SCOPE
- Focus on bash scripting
- Include security considerations
- Include modern tools and techniques

# SEED LIST
- Security best practices
- Performance optimizations
- Testing frameworks
- Modern bash features

# RULES
- Remove items from SEED LIST as they're completed
- Add new items discovered during research
- Save findings to docs/research/[topic].md
- Minimal output - focus on key insights
- If done, print exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

# VERIFIERS
- [[ -d "docs/research" ]] && echo "✓ Research directory exists"
- [[ $(find docs/research -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l) -gt 0 ]] && echo "✓ Research files created"
```

`examples/code-refactor.md`:
```markdown
# TASK
Refactor the following function to improve readability and maintainability.

# RULES
- Preserve all functionality
- Add comments explaining changes
- Run all VERIFIERS before finishing
- If done, print exactly: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

# VERIFIERS
- [[ -f "refactored.py" ]] && echo "✓ Refactored file exists"
- python3 -m py_compile refactored.py && echo "✓ Syntax valid"
- bash -n ralph.sh && echo "✓ ralph.sh still valid"
```

**Rationale:** Provides starting points, demonstrates best practices, reduces learning curve.
