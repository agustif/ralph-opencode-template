**Status:** ACCEPTED

### 1.3 Validate Spec File Size and Type
**Location:** ralph.sh:57

**Issue:** No validation of spec file size or type - could cause resource exhaustion.

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add after line 57
SPEC_SIZE=$(stat -c%s "$SPEC" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$SPEC" 2>/dev/null)
[[ "$SPEC_SIZE" -gt 1048576 ]] && { echo "Spec file too large (>1MB): $SPEC"; exit 1; }
[[ "$SPEC" == *.md ]] || [[ "$SPEC" == *.txt ]] || { echo "Spec file must be .md or .txt: $SPEC"; exit 1; }
```

**Rationale:** Prevents memory issues from large files and ensures expected file types.
