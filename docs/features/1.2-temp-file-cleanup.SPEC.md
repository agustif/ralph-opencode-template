# Suggestion 1.2: Add Temp File Cleanup on Interrupt

**Status:** ACCEPTED

**Original Location:** ralph.sh:74-77

**Rationale:** Prevents disk pollution from orphaned temporary files when the script is interrupted. This is a simple security and robustness improvement that requires minimal code changes and uses standard bash trap mechanisms.

### 1.2 Add Temp File Cleanup on Interrupt
**Location:** ralph.sh:74-77

**Issue:** Temp files aren't cleaned up if script is interrupted (SIGINT/SIGTERM).

**Recommendation:**
```bash
# Add trap handler at beginning of cmd_run
trap 'rm -f "$TMPOUT" 2>/dev/null; exit 130' INT TERM

# Wrap temp file usage
TMPOUT=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$TMPOUT" 2>/dev/null; exit 130' INT TERM
timeout "$TIMEOUT" opencode run "$INSTRUCTION" --file "$SPEC" -m "$MODEL" 2>&1 | tee "$TMPOUT" || true
OUTPUT=$(strip_ansi < "$TMPOUT")
rm -f "$TMPOUT"
trap - INT TERM
```

**Rationale:** Prevents disk pollution from orphaned temp files during interruptions.
